Things we discussed today:
We will be adding a GUI to make it easier to construct more and better UML Diagrams. 
This will result in more use cases as well as better looking class diagram/sequence diagram etc


Things that need to be done til wednesday 17/5:
Component Diagram - Benjamin
Design Document - Patrik
Sequence Diagram - Jonathan
Design Space & Class diagram - Michael
Activity Diagram & update/add use cases - Christofer


When doing this, think a little about the code we will write and think about applicable design patterns and architectural pattern we can use to this later.

Keep track on time spent doing this, so we can add that to the time schedule document on wednesday.
